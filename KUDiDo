<h1>People In Society as of the current</h1>
<p> they're basically three types of people who live on earth</p>
<ol>
<li> those who have extreme power.<span> these control the world and are looked up to</span></li>
<li> those who have moderate power.<span> these get instructions from the extremely powerful people and are in direct work with other people</span></li>
<li> those who don't have power at all.<span>these are used by those who have moderate power</span></li>
</ol>
<p> we all strive to have power without knowing how to use it, this results in chaos, it can bring about wars and total loss of human life. at times having great power is not good for some individuals.</p>
